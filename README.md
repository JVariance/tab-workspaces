# Tab Workspaces

This is a fork of [Workspaces](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tab-workspaces/) by @fonse

## Improvements:

 - Use of Firefox' hideTab-API --> Tabs are no longer closed and completely reloaded when adding or switching workspaces
 - Redesign -> Dark Theme added
 - (nyi) Switch to next Workspace if last tab of current Workspace got closed

_______________________________________
Organize your tabs into workspaces. Switch between workspaces to change which tabs are displayed at the moment.

This extension aims to be an alternative to [Tab Groups](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-groups-panorama/), which is no longer supported as of Firefox 57.

## Features

 - Each tab belongs to a workspace. New tabs are automatically added to the current workspace.
 - Switch between workspaces from the toolbar icon to keep your tabs organized.
 - Tabs in other workspaces are safely hidden away.
 - Pinned tabs are visible from all workspaces.
 - If you have multiple windows open, each one has its own set of workspaces.
 - Send a specific tab to another workspace from the right-click menu.
 - Press Ctrl+Alt+W to open the list of workspaces, then press 1-9 to switch between using keyboard shortcuts.
 - Search through your tabs in the address bar. Type "ws [text]" to begin searching. Choose a result to switch to that tab.

## Acknowledgements

This extension was inspired by [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/), which also served as a reference for some of the functionality.

Special thanks to [@NicolasJEngler](http://nicolasjengler.com.ar/) for designing a beautiful UI for this extension!
